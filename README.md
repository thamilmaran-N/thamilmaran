## Projects

### Patient Bed Monitoring System
- Components Used: ESP 32, Load Cell, HX711 Amplifier, MPU6050, 3.7v Li-ion Battery, BM-10 Bluetooth module, 3.3v Voltage Regulator, LEDs, Resistors, Slide Switch, 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- Here the Main Goal of this project is to Detect the patient presence in the Hospital Beds
- To Reach the Goal of this project we use two specific Units one is Bed unit and Wrist band Unit
- Bed Unit: Here the Bed unit has ESP 32,Load cell, HX711 Amplifier, MPU6050, 3.7v Li-ion Battery, 16x2 I2C LCD Display
- Wrist Band Unit: In this unit the compact Design has BM-10 Bluetooth Module, 3.3v Voltage Regulator, 3.7v Li-ion Battery, Slide Switch, LED, Resistor
- The Load Cell in the Bed Unit is Place Under the Bed to detect the Weight in the bed
- The Wrist band is a wearable Device to the Patient
- Now the Bluetooth module in the Wrist band is Connected Via Bluetooth connecticity to the ESP32 in Bed Unit so get the Connectivity Signal Strength
- If the Signal strength is low and the Patient Weight is not Detected it Indicate the Patient Absence
- If the Signal Strength is High but the Patient Weight is Not detected or the Signal Strength is low but the Patient Weight is detected its abnormal State
- If Signal Strength is High but the Patient Weight is detected Patient is Present
- Then This Data are tranfered to Firebase Data Magement Via ESP32 using Wifi Connectivity for the Future Enhancement

### Egg Incubator
- Designed an automatic temperature and humidity-controlled incubator system.
- Implemented heating control, LCD display, and real-time monitoring using IoT platforms.

### Robotic Hand
